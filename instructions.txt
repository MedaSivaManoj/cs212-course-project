How to Run:
-----------
1. Open two terminal windows (or two machines if needed).
2. In the first terminal, run the server script:
   > python3 server.py

   This will open a GUI for Player 1 (X). Wait here for the client to connect.

3. In the second terminal, run the client script:
   > python3 client.py

   This opens a GUI for Player 2 (O) and connects to the server.

4. Play the game turn by turn. Only the active playerâ€™s timer will count down.
   If a player runs out of time, they lose automatically.

5. Use the "Send Msg" button to chat, and "Reset Game" to restart the board.

Important Notes:
----------------
- The server must be started before the client.
- Both files use hardcoded localhost IP: 127.0.0.1 and port 5000.
  You can modify them in the scripts if testing across different machines.
